Choose a dataset and problem:
For this example, let's use the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. Our goal will be to predict passenger survival.
Prepare the data:

Data Preparation

Create and train the model:

Model Training

Deploy the model to Vertex AI:

To deploy the model to Vertex AI, you'll need to:
a) Create a model artifact
b) Upload the model to Google Cloud Storage
c) Create a model resource in Vertex AI
d) Deploy the model


Vertex AI Deploymen

Run batch predictions:

To run batch predictions, you'll need to:
a) Prepare your input data in the correct format
b) Create a batch prediction job
Here's a script to do this:
Batch PredictionClick to open code
To use this setup:

Ensure you have the necessary GCP SDK and libraries installed.
Set up your GCP project and enable the required APIs (Vertex AI, Cloud Storage).
Prepare your data as shown in step 2.
Train your model as in step 3.
Deploy your model to Vertex AI using the script in step 4.
Prepare your input data for batch prediction and upload it to GCS.
Run the batch prediction script from step 5.

Remember to replace placeholder values like 'your-project-id' and 'your-bucket-name' with your actual GCP project and bucket details.
This example provides a basic framework. In a production environment, you'd want to add error handling, logging, and 
possibly use more advanced features of Vertex AI like custom containers or pipeline orchestration.
First, let's look at a sample batch_predict_input.csv:
csvCopyPclass,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Fare,Embarked_Q,Embarked_S
3,0,22.0,1,0,7.25,0,1
1,1,38.0,1,0,71.2833,0,0
3,1,26.0,0,0,7.925,0,1
1,1,35.0,1,0,53.1,0,1
3,0,35.0,0,0,8.05,0,1
This CSV file represents the preprocessed and scaled features we used to train our model. Here's what each column represents:

Pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
Sex: Gender (0 = male; 1 = female)
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents / children aboard
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked_Q: Whether the passenger embarked at Queenstown (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Embarked_S: Whether the passenger embarked at Southampton (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Now, let's discuss how the output from the batch prediction job would look:
When you run a batch prediction job in Vertex AI, it generates output files in the Google Cloud Storage location you specified (in our case, gs://{BUCKET_NAME}/output/). The output typically includes:

Prediction results file(s)
A metadata file

The prediction results file(s) would be in CSV format, with each row corresponding to a row in your input file. It might look something like this:
csvCopypredicted_class,prediction_probabilities
0,[0.82,0.18]
1,[0.25,0.75]
0,[0.91,0.09]
1,[0.15,0.85]
0,[0.78,0.22]
Here's what each column means:

predicted_class: The model's prediction (0 = Did not survive; 1 = Survived)
prediction_probabilities: A list of probabilities for each class [probability of not surviving, probability of surviving]

The metadata file (usually in JSON format) would contain information about the batch prediction job, such as:

The model used
The timestamp of the prediction
The number of instances predicted
Any errors or anomalies encountered during prediction

To access these results:

You can use the Google Cloud Console to navigate to your storage bucket and download the files.
Alternatively, you can use the gsutil command-line tool or the Google Cloud Storage client library in your code to programmatically download and process the results.
